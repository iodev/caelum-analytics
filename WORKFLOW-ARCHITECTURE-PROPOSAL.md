# 5-Workflow Architecture Proposal
## Solving the External LLM Tool Limit Problem

### Current Problem
- **169+ individual tools** across 20 MCP servers
- **GitHub Copilot limit**: 100 tools maximum
- **Complex tool discovery** for users and LLMs
- **Inefficient resource usage** with overlapping functionality

### Proposed Solution: 5 Super-Workflow Servers

Instead of 20 individual servers, consolidate into **5 workflow-centric servers** that internally route to appropriate services:

## 1. üõ†Ô∏è **Caelum Development Workflow**
**Purpose**: Complete development lifecycle management  
**Internal Services**: code-analysis, project-intelligence, development-session  
**Key Tools** (15-20 max exposed):
- `analyze_code_quality` - Code analysis with security, performance, quality
- `analyze_project_structure` - Project intelligence and dependencies  
- `track_development_session` - Time tracking and productivity
- `search_code_patterns` - Find similar code across projects
- `get_development_metrics` - Development progress and statistics
- `optimize_code_performance` - Performance optimization suggestions

## 2. üíº **Caelum Business Intelligence Workflow**  
**Purpose**: Market research, opportunities, business analysis  
**Internal Services**: business-intelligence, opportunity-discovery, user-profile  
**Key Tools** (15-20 max exposed):
- `research_market_intelligence` - Comprehensive market research
- `discover_business_opportunities` - Opportunity identification
- `analyze_competitive_landscape` - Competitor analysis
- `generate_business_insights` - Business intelligence reports
- `track_user_preferences` - User profile and context management
- `forecast_market_trends` - Trend analysis and forecasting

## 3. üèóÔ∏è **Caelum Infrastructure Workflow**
**Purpose**: Infrastructure management, deployment, orchestration  
**Internal Services**: device-orchestration, cluster-communication, workflow-orchestration  
**Key Tools** (15-20 max exposed):
- `orchestrate_multi_device` - Cross-device coordination
- `deploy_infrastructure` - Deployment management
- `manage_cluster_communication` - Inter-system communication
- `execute_distributed_workflow` - Workflow automation
- `monitor_system_health` - Infrastructure monitoring
- `scale_resources` - Resource scaling and optimization

## 4. üì¢ **Caelum Communication Workflow**
**Purpose**: Notifications, knowledge management, content  
**Internal Services**: notifications, intelligence-hub, knowledge-management  
**Key Tools** (15-20 max exposed):
- `send_smart_notification` - Intelligent cross-platform notifications
- `manage_knowledge_base` - Knowledge management and retrieval
- `aggregate_intelligence` - Intelligence hub coordination
- `create_content_summary` - Content analysis and summarization
- `sync_cross_device` - Cross-device synchronization
- `search_knowledge_graph` - Knowledge graph queries

## 5. üîí **Caelum Security Workflow**
**Purpose**: Security, compliance, monitoring  
**Internal Services**: security-compliance, security-management, performance-optimization  
**Key Tools** (15-20 max exposed):
- `scan_security_vulnerabilities` - Comprehensive security scanning
- `check_compliance_status` - Regulatory compliance checking
- `manage_api_keys` - API key rotation and management
- `encrypt_sensitive_data` - Data encryption services
- `audit_system_access` - Access logging and auditing
- `optimize_security_performance` - Security-performance balance

## Implementation Strategy

### Internal Routing Architecture
Each workflow server implements:
```typescript
interface WorkflowServer {
  // Public MCP interface - only exposes 15-20 tools
  async handleToolCall(toolName: string, args: any): Promise<any>
  
  // Internal routing to appropriate services
  private async routeToService(intent: string, args: any): Promise<any>
  
  // Context-aware tool selection
  private selectRelevantTools(queryContext: QueryContext): Tool[]
}
```

### Benefits

**For External LLMs:**
- ‚úÖ **5 servers** instead of 20 (much easier to manage)
- ‚úÖ **~80 total tools** instead of 169+ (fits GitHub Copilot limit)
- ‚úÖ **Workflow-based discovery** (more intuitive)
- ‚úÖ **Context-aware tool exposure** (only relevant tools shown)

**For Users:**
- üéØ **Intuitive organization** (users think in workflows)
- ‚ö° **Faster tool discovery** (less overwhelming)
- üîÑ **Consistent interfaces** (similar patterns across workflows)
- üìä **Better integration** (workflows share context)

**For System:**
- üí∞ **Reduced overhead** (5 processes vs 20)
- üîß **Easier maintenance** (consolidated logic)
- üìà **Better monitoring** (workflow-level metrics)
- üöÄ **Improved performance** (shared resources)

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Create Workflow Facade Servers (1 week)
Create the 5 workflow servers that route to existing underlying services

### Phase 2: Intelligent Tool Selection (1 week)  
Implement context-aware tool selection within each workflow

### Phase 3: Update Claude Configuration (1 day)
Replace 20 individual servers with 5 workflow servers in MCP config

### Phase 4: Deprecate Individual Servers (2 weeks)
Gradually phase out direct access to underlying servers

## Example Configuration

**New `.claude.json`:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "caelum-development-workflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/caelum/workflow-servers/development/index.js"],
      "description": "Complete development lifecycle management"
    },
    "caelum-business-workflow": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["/caelum/workflow-servers/business/index.js"],
      "description": "Business intelligence and market research"
    },
    "caelum-infrastructure-workflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/caelum/workflow-servers/infrastructure/index.js"], 
      "description": "Infrastructure and deployment management"
    },
    "caelum-communication-workflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/caelum/workflow-servers/communication/index.js"],
      "description": "Communication and knowledge management"
    },
    "caelum-security-workflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/caelum/workflow-servers/security/index.js"],
      "description": "Security, compliance, and optimization"
    }
  }
}
```

## Tool Limit Compliance

**GitHub Copilot (100 tool limit):**
- Core Claude tools: ~15 tools
- 5 workflow servers √ó 15 tools each = 75 tools  
- **Total: ~90 tools** ‚úÖ (Under limit)

**Other Providers:**
- Can expose more tools per workflow as needed
- Smart context-aware selection ensures relevance

This architecture solves the external LLM tool limit problem while providing a much better user experience and system efficiency.
